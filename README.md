# PatikaStore App

An example app that can add/list/delete products, categorized as cellphones and notebooks. 

The app contains a parent Product class that implements generic features of a product, and Notebook and Cellphone classes will inherit the functions from this class and extends it to support the additional features that the products of their categories.

This is a command-line app and in-app browsing is maintained with Scanner.nextInt() method, along with a parent and sub level tracking mechanism for easier browsing.

The code could be much better, but done in a short period of time, due to the ongoing university homeworks and projects, along with my graduation project and internship project.

The app does not have a proper handling of invalid inputs.
